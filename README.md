## Why

I have several users cases where I need authentication for a simple app or project. Most of these use cases have a maximum of 5 users.  I do not want to have to stand up a database or use an existing database just for the authentication part of the application.  I now can use this simple method.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/SimpleAuthenticationDemoForBlazor
   cd SimpleAuthenticationDemoForBlazor
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
   a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. Set up a custom Authentication Provider
2. How to set the user as logged in or not 
3. Added a log in page
4. Added a forgot password page, even though it does not do anything.
5. I used the standard Blazor server template but styled it using TailwindCss
